# GenAI Hackathon Series Repository

Welcome to the GenAI Hackathon Series Repository. This repository contains code snippets and examples for a series of GenAI hackathons that will be running throughout the next year. We will be focusing on 8 use cases, each with its own dedicated subfolder in this repository.

## Technologies

We will be using a range of Google's technologies across these hackathons, including:

- GenAI Studio
- VertexAI
- Colab
- BigQuery
- BigQuery Machine Learning (BQML)
- Gemini

## Use Cases

The 8 use cases we will be focusing on are:

1. **Sentiment Analysis**
2. **Social Media Analysis**
3. **Code Documentation**
4. **Test Data Creation**
5. **Metadata Search**
6. [**Table Content Inference**](https://github.com/andrewankenobi/DataGenAIHackaton/tree/main/6.Table%20Content%20Inference)
7. **Data Quality**
8. **Summarize PDF reports**

Each use case has its own dedicated subfolder containing relevant code snippets and examples.
